The Student Grading System is a simple, console-based Java application designed to manage student grades.
This system demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming principles such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and exception handling.
The program allows teachers to assign grades to students, automatically evaluates the grade (e.g., Fail, Re-exam, Pass, Distinction),
and displays relevant details for each student and teacher.

Classes and Inheritance: Represents Person, Student, and Teacher classes with hierarchical relationships.
Polymorphism: Uses method overriding to handle different behaviors across classes.
Exception Handling: Manages invalid input and out-of-range grades gracefully.
Grade Evaluation: Provides automatic evaluation based on grading criteria:
Below 40: Fail
40 - 49: Qualifies for Re-exam
50 - 74: Pass
75 and above: Pass with Distinction
